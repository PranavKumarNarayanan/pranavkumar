<p>Often when people talk about masculinity, they mention things like ‚Äúsubtly dominating‚Äù, ‚Äútaking control‚Äù or even too immature to say ‚Äúmen don‚Äôt cry.‚Äù
But when you analyze yourself and others very deeply, even if masculinity is (wrongly) defined that way, its not true.</p>
<p>Every man cries, just not in front of everyone. Everybody loves to dominate until they have confidence in themselves. Everybody wants to take control as long as they are acquainted with the knowledge over which they will be taking control.</p>
<p>But all these constraints break. So much so that its actually not very accurate to define masculinity that way.</p>
<p>If something isn‚Äôt natural, if something isn‚Äôt going to be persistent in all scenarios, then it isn‚Äôt actually true, atleast not true enough to be have aspirations upon. People break, people cry, people feel insecure, people have vulnerabilities. But this very definition of masculinity is rendering all of that pointless. But here is the thing, they are an integral part of every man‚Äôs life.</p>
<p>We dismiss the concept of vulnerabilities among men so much so that they become helpless when they actually feel them. We un-define the term ‚Äúinsecurities‚Äù in the lives of men so much so that they don‚Äôt know how to handle them. And human psychology is interesting. Humans are very intelligent when it comes to being angry. Because it is the most natural emotion one can feel. Starting right from the birth. That is why people convert their saddness into anger, if we actually think behind the reasons of their anger.</p>
<p>And nothing short of the same happens here when men are exposed to emotions that they were refused by the society to be felt. So here is my take on what masculinity should be</p>
<h2 id="artistic-masculinity">Artistic Masculinity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Masculinity is an art in itself. And graciously portraying it is a blessing if you ask me. But since the society has deeply and strongly accepted the ‚Äútoxic‚Äù form of masculinity, I would refer my version of masculinity as <strong>Artistic masculinity</strong> in this blog.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="krishnas-archetype-charisma-with-compassion">Krishna‚Äôs Archetype: Charisma with Compassion</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs take the example of Lord Krishna. He wasn‚Äôt just masculine. He was divine, he was loving, he had vulnerabilities in love, and wasn‚Äôt ashamed of crying.
He cried when he met his friend, when he left his sister. The reason I‚Äôm taking up this example is not to encourage everyone to cry ü§£, but to emphasize the fact that crying doesn‚Äôt make you weak. I don‚Äôt think anyone considers Krishna to be weak, do they?
So is it only crying? No!
He was a</p>
<ol>
<li>Flute player melting hearts - And I have personally been mocked by several people for being a musician than not being a sports person.</li>
<li>But he was not short of masculinity too ‚Äî He was a warrior and a statesman leading with clarity.</li>
<li>Lover who was emotionally vulnerable but never weak</li>
<li>Friend who protected others with fierce loyalty.</li>
</ol>
<p>So build your version of that.</p>
<h3 id="mindset-rooted-but-not-rigid">Mindset: Rooted, but not rigid</h3>
<p>Refining your character comes deep from knowing your powers. But it also can go south really quick if you flaunt it. Quiet strength is always louder than noise.
If you are strong physically, it‚Äôs to protect others and/or lead a healthy life. Not to hurt others or boast it.
If you can sing, it‚Äôs to entertain others and enjoy yourself. Not to flaunt it to people who are trying to do the same.
If you code really well, it‚Äôs for your own good and good for your career(probably). Not to make others develop inferiority complex</p>
<p><strong>Now get that agressiveness outta you for god‚Äôs sake.</strong>
If you had watched any of the confidence boosting videos that preach you to act insensitively and indifferently, trust me. None of it will make you feel confident about yourself. You are just building a protective shield around you that prevents people from knowing the little kid inside you, insecure and frightened. Confidence comes from inside, not an outer fake shell
Aggressivenes and assertiveness are two diifferent things. You need confidence to be assertive and speak up for yourself. But you just have to be an insecure piece of crap to be aggressive to everyone. So stop that.</p>
<h3 id="aesthetic-and-expression">Aesthetic and Expression</h3>
<p>Dress with intention: pair neutral tones with one bold accessory ‚Äî or don‚Äôt. Doesn‚Äôt matter. All of this matters only if you have the kindness and compassion in your heart.
Cultivate creative outlets ‚Äî I can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve told this to people who look up to me in character development. Practicing arts like music, writing, dancing, painting, they don‚Äôt make you less of a man, but they make you more whole.
Use body language that is calm, open and deliberate. Refining your mind comes with a side package of refining your body language. Be confident about your body. Doesn‚Äôt matter how you look. It all depends on how you perceive yourselves. Make confident yet kind gestures that portray your character at best.</p>
<p>And at last, be humble. Humility is the biggest boon one can get in my opinion. Anybody with over confidence can be rude and arrogant, but it takes a whole load of effort and tolerance to be a humble person. And generally more efforts are always good, so be humble. üòÅüòÅ</p>
<h3 id="stoic-quote">Stoic quote</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To be humble to superiors is duty; to equals is courtesy; to inferiors is nobleness; and to all, safety!</p>
